pic-tools
=========

Tools for managing my image collection.

My workflow is camera --> canonical naming --> selection.
"Selection" means pick a handful that I think are the best of some
collection.

Sometimes I want a smaller image to mail or post.

On the todo list is global classification and tagging.

Contributions of course welcome.
